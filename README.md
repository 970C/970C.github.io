Hi, I'm Jon. 

I make code for a living and love doing it! I am a part of a small team that manages a Drupal multi-site install. The team I work with is great and make what I do worth it, every day. I really enjoy coding in Javascript and feel that it's like painting when I do it, but I'm also well-versed in PHP, HTML, CSS, and the general LAMP stack.
